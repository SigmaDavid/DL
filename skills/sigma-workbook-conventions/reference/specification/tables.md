# Tables

The `table` and `pivot-table` element kinds. (`input-table` moved to
`input-tables.md` — 2026-08-04, Wave 3 / C5.)

```bash
jq '.components.schemas.Table, .components.schemas.PivotTable' /tmp/sigma-api.json
```

The `table` element is the most common element kind and the primary way
data enters a workbook — charts, KPIs, and other elements usually point
their `source` at a table.

## Basic shape

```json
{
  "id": "sales-table",
  "kind": "table",
  "name": "Sales Data",
  "source": {
    "kind": "warehouse-table",
    "connectionId": "<conn-uuid>",
    "path": ["DATABASE", "SCHEMA", "TABLE"]
  },
  "columns": [
    { "id": "col-1", "name": "Column Name", "formula": "[TABLE/column_name]" },
    { "id": "col-2", "name": "Total", "formula": "Sum([Column Name])" }
  ],
  "order": ["col-1", "col-2"]
}
```

See `sources.md` for all source kinds and `formulas.md` for
column-reference rules. Every column needs `id`, `name`, `formula`;
optional `format` (see `formatting.md`).

## Styled `name` + `description` + `noDataText`

`name` accepts either a plain string OR a styled object for headers
— same shape as KPI / chart titles:

```json
"name": {
  "text": "Sales Data",
  "fontSize": 18,
  "fontWeight": "bold"
}
```

Tables also accept optional `description` and `noDataText`:

```json
"description": {
  "text": "Latest quarter"
},
"noDataText": "No rows in range"
```

The shape mirrors chart titles; fetch `TitleSection` from the
OpenAPI for the full styling enum.

**`description` must be an object on tables (and KPIs).** POST
rejects a plain-string `description` with `Invalid object: string`.
Even if you just want a plain caption, wrap it:

```json
"description": { "text": "Distinct SKUs with < 100 units sold" }
```

To hide the description entirely:

```json
"description": { "visibility": "hidden" }
```

Verified 2026-07-02 against `inventory-health` build (1 POST retry).

## Common optional fields

### `order`

Array of column IDs controlling left-to-right display order.
Defaults to declaration order.

### `groupings` — multi-level aggregation

Creates a hierarchical / pivot view without changing element kind.
Each entry is one **level** in the hierarchy:

```json
"groupings": [
  {
    "id": "by-region",
    "groupBy": ["col-region"],
    "calculations": ["col-total", "col-profit"]
  },
  {
    "id": "by-product",
    "groupBy": ["col-product-line"],
    "calculations": ["col-line-rev", "col-pct-of-total"]
  }
]
```

The shape `{id, groupBy: [<col-id>], calculations: [<col-id>]}` is
canonical. Legacy `{id, columnId}` and `{id}`-only forms are
render-hint serializations from older GET-backs — they don't
aggregate. Use the canonical shape for any new authoring. See
`reference/history.md` → "2026-05-13 — Cohort iteration."

**Every column in `columns[]` must be either a `groupBy` dimension or a
`calculations` entry once a table has `groupings` — an orphaned column
(declared in `columns[]` but referenced by neither) renders as a
nonsensical "summary" value instead of the actual per-row data.**
Verified 2026-08-03: a state-filtered detail table grouped by Product
Name only, with `Store State` declared as a plain passthrough column
outside the grouping structure (kept only so a filter control had an
`id` to bind to), displayed a garbled value for Store State instead of
the state name. Fix: fold every column that needs to appear meaningfully
into either `groupBy` (as an additional dimension — a compound
`groupBy: ["col-a", "col-b"]` is accepted, not just single-column) or
`calculations`. If a column only exists so a control can filter on it
and doesn't need to be *visible*, that's a signal to reconsider whether
it belongs on this element at all, rather than leaving it structurally
homeless.

Multi-level groupings produce real `GROUP BY` SQL — one per level,
joined so each detail row carries the aggregates from its ancestor
levels. Canonical example:
`examples/data-model-sourced-multi-level-aggregated-table.json`.

### `summary` — summary-bar pattern

A top-level field on the table element (singular `summary`, NOT
`summaries`). Each entry is a column id whose formula is evaluated
at the summary-bar grain (across all rows of the table). The
summary value is broadcast to every row.

```json
"summary": ["col-median-margin"]
```

Use cases: median/mean/percentile thresholds for downstream
bucketing columns, or a plain broadcast anchor (an as-of date, a
grand total) that doesn't need any bucketing at all. **`groupings` is
NOT a prerequisite** — `summary` is a standalone table-level field and
works on an ungrouped table just as well as a grouped one. Confirmed
live 2026-08-13 on both a plain table and a grouped table in the same
build session (see `reference/history.md` → "2026-08-13 (continued) —
`summary` does not require `groupings`"). `groupings` only becomes
necessary if you're also composing the categorization pattern in
`reference/conventions.md` → "Summary-bar pattern" (bucketing rows
against an aggregated metric) — full pattern + rationale for that
specific use case there.

**`summary` × `groupings.calculations` are mutually exclusive.** A
column id in `summary` MUST NOT also appear in any grouping's
`calculations` list. POST rejects with
`Duplicate column or folder reference: '<col-id>'`. Verified
2026-07-02 against `exec-scorecard` v1 (blocked mid-build).

If you need both the summary-bar view AND the per-group aggregation,
define **two separate columns** with distinct ids and the same
formula. Put one in `summary`, the other in `calculations`.

### `filters` — top-N, element-level row filters

```json
"filters": [
  {
    "id": "top-20",
    "columnId": "col-revenue",
    "kind": "top-n",
    "rankingFunction": "rank",
    "mode": "top-n",
    "rowCount": 20,
    "includeNulls": "when-no-value-is-selected"
  }
]
```

> **`rowCount` takes a number literal only** — cannot be parametrized
> by a control. `rowCount: "[TopN]"` is rejected. Control bindings
> apply to filter **values**, not structural fields like `rowCount`,
> `rankingFunction`, `mode`, or `kind`. To vary the cap interactively,
> duplicate the element per cap.

### `visibleAsSource`

Boolean. Whether this table is exposed as a source for other
elements on the page. Defaults to `false` (often) — set explicitly
to `true` for parent tables that downstream KPIs/charts source from.

### `folders` — column folder groupings

```json
"folders": [
  { "id": "store-fields", "name": "Store Fields",
    "items": ["col-store-key", "col-store-name", "col-store-region"] },
  { "id": "customer-fields", "name": "Customer Fields",
    "items": ["col-cust-key", "col-cust-name"] }
]
```

UI-side organization for tables with many columns. Doesn't affect
render or downstream references; just collapses column groups in
the table header.

### `tableStyle` — banding + presets + header styling

Table-level visual styling:

```json
"tableStyle": {
  "banding": "shown",
  "preset": "presentation",
  "cellSpacing": "extra-small",
  "textStyles": {
    "header": { "backgroundColor": "#e2e2e2" }
  }
}
```

| Field | Observed values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `banding` | `"shown"` | Row banding on/off |
| `preset` | `"presentation"` | Named style preset |
| `cellSpacing` | `"extra-small"` | d3-style enum |
| `textStyles.header.backgroundColor` | hex color | Header cell background |

Verified 2026-07-02 against `sales-mbr-sentinel`. Full enum values
live in the OpenAPI:

```bash
jq '.components.schemas.TableStyle // .. | select(.properties?.banding? or .properties?.preset?)' /tmp/sigma-api.json
```

### `tableComponents` — collapsed columns / summary bar toggles

**Corrected 2026-08-10.** Earlier versions of this doc described
`collapsedColumns` as an array of column IDs. The only live instance
found shows a **string** toggle instead, paired with a sibling
`summaryBar` field (also a string):

```json
"tableComponents": {
  "collapsedColumns": "hidden",
  "summaryBar": "hidden"
}
```

Both `collapsedColumns` and `summaryBar` read as UI-visibility toggles
for a components region, not a per-column list. Confirmed value for
both: `"hidden"`. Other enum values are unverified — don't guess what
else the enum might include.

## Conditional formatting — `conditionalFormats`

Threshold-based cell coloring. Verified 2026-05-21 against the
official skill — round-trips through GET unchanged; PUT-based edits
are stable.

```bash
jq '.components.schemas.ConditionalFormatSingle, .components.schemas.ConditionalFormatBackgroundScale, .components.schemas.ConditionalFormatFontScale, .components.schemas.ConditionalFormatDataBars' /tmp/sigma-api.json
```

Four variants: `single` (threshold rules), `backgroundScale`
(gradient scale on cell bg), `fontScale` (gradient on font color),
`dataBars` (inline data bars in the cell).

### `single` — red/green threshold

```json
"conditionalFormats": [
  {
    "type": "single",
    "columnIds": ["col-revenue"],
    "condition": ">",
    "value": 1000,
    "style": { "backgroundColor": "#22c55e" }
  },
  {
    "type": "single",
    "columnIds": ["col-revenue"],
    "condition": "<",
    "value": 100,
    "style": { "backgroundColor": "#ef4444" }
  }
]
```

Condition operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `IsNull`,
`IsNotNull`, `Contains`, `NotContains`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`,
`Between`, `NotBetween`, and `formula` (arbitrary boolean).

Style block supports `backgroundColor`, `color`, `bold`, `italic`,
`underline`, and column-level `format` override.

### `backgroundScale` — heatmap-style gradient

```json
{
  "type": "backgroundScale",
  "columnIds": ["col-revenue"],
  "scheme": ["#fef3c7", "#fbbf24", "#dc2626"],
  "domain": [0, 5000, 10000]
}
```

### `fontScale` — gradient on text color

```json
{
  "type": "fontScale",
  "columnIds": ["col-margin"],
  "scheme": ["#ef4444", "#fbbf24", "#22c55e"]
}
```

### `dataBars` — inline horizontal bars

**Confirmed 2026-08-10 (2 independent live examples — one `table`, one
`pivot-table`):** uses `scheme` (array of colors), not a singular
`color`. Also carries an optional `includeValues: true` boolean
(undocumented; also seen alongside `backgroundScale`).

```json
{
  "type": "dataBars",
  "columnIds": ["col-revenue"],
  "scheme": ["#eaff00", "#8300ed"],
  "includeValues": true
}
```

### Round-trip status — verify before relying

> claims `conditionalFormats` round-trips cleanly. **This skill's
> earlier observation that pivot cell heatmaps break GET-spec was

# Pivot tables

The `pivot-table` element is a sibling of `table` for cross-tab
analysis — measure cells aggregated across one or more row/column
dimensions.

## Shape

Pivots need **three explicit fields** on top of `columns`: `rowsBy`,
`columnsBy`, and `values`. Without `rowsBy` + `columnsBy`, the pivot
collapses to a single grand-total row — no rows or columns render.

```json
{
  "id": "deployments-pivot",
  "kind": "pivot-table",
  "name": "Deployments by cloud and env",
  "source": { "kind": "table", "elementId": "deployments-source" },
  "columns": [
    { "id": "piv-cloud", "name": "Cloud", "formula": "[Deployments/Cloud]" },
    { "id": "piv-env",   "name": "Environment", "formula": "[Deployments/Environment]" },
    { "id": "piv-count", "name": "Deployments",
      "formula": "CountDistinct([Deployments/Deployment UUID])",
      "format": { "kind": "number", "formatString": ",.0f" } }
  ],
  "rowsBy":    [ { "id": "piv-cloud" } ],
  "columnsBy": [ { "id": "piv-env" } ],
  "values":    [ "piv-count" ]
}
```

Field roles:

- **`columns`** — every column referenced by the pivot (dimensions AND
  measures), each with `id`, `name`, `formula`.
- **`rowsBy`** — array of `{ id: <column-id> }` entries. Each entry
  becomes a row-axis dimension. Multiple entries stack (multi-level rows).
- **`columnsBy`** — array of `{ id: <column-id> }` entries. Each becomes
  a column-axis dimension. Multi-level columns work the same way.
- **`values`** — array of column-ID strings. Each is a measure that
  fills the pivot's cells at each (row, column) intersection.

Both `rowsBy` and `columnsBy` entries accept an optional `sort` field:

```json
"rowsBy":    [ { "id": "piv-region", "sort": { "by": "piv-current", "direction": "descending" } } ],
"columnsBy": [ { "id": "piv-quarter", "sort": { "by": "piv-quarter-num", "direction": "ascending" } } ]
```

**Common trap** — including a dimension in `columns` but forgetting
to bind it via `rowsBy` or `columnsBy` renders it as a leaf column on
the source table rather than a pivot axis. The pivot compiles cleanly
(passes validate + verify) but the UI shows only the grand total for
the measure. Verified 2026-07-02 against `Product-and-Basket-Performance`
before a PUT fix added `rowsBy`/`columnsBy` to both pivots.

**Heatmap pattern** (dimension × dimension × measure with cell coloring)
uses this exact shape plus `conditionalFormats` with the
`backgroundScale` variant — see below.

## Round-trip quirks

- **Column reordering.** Sigma reorders the `columns` array on
  round-trip — value columns first, then dimensions — regardless of
  submission order. GET → edit → PUT will show a non-substantive
  diff in `columns`. The `rowsBy` / `columnsBy` / `values` bindings
  preserve IDs, so rendered output is unchanged.

## Pivot conditional formatting — status

Pivot `conditionalFormats` historically broke GET-spec (returns
`service_error` 500). Per the 2026-05-21 official-skill merger, the
upstream skill claims this is fixed.

**Retested 2026-08-13 — confirmed fixed for `backgroundScale`.** A
from-scratch POST of a pivot-table with `backgroundScale` conditional
formatting on its value column succeeded (200), and an immediate
`GET /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec` read it back cleanly (200, no
`service_error`) — see `reference/capability-ledger.md`'s `pivot-table`
row for the full evidence. The historical GET-spec-500 risk does not
apply to this shape on this org as of that retest. Still apply pivot
conditional formatting LAST in the iteration cycle as a general habit —
the other three `conditionalFormats` variants (`single`, `fontScale`,
`dataBars`) on a pivot were not part of this retest and remain
unconfirmed.

## Cohort pivot pattern

For weeks-since-first-action / cohort retention analyses, build a
two-tier source structure and pivot the derived table by cohort
week × age week. Canonical example:
`examples/data-model-sourced-cohort-pivot.json`.

The pivot's columns include both dimensions (cohort dim + age dim)
and aggregated values (`Sum([Revenue])`, `CountDistinct([Cust Key])`).
See `reference/conventions.md` → "Two-tier sourcing."

# Input tables

Moved to its own chunk: **`reference/specification/input-tables.md`**
(2026-08-04, Wave 3 / C5) — split out because it's the only element
kind where the workbook holds state *the user typed*, which changes
correctness reasoning globally (idempotency, seeding, latest-row-wins).
Every shape there is now live-POST verified (previously GET-spec/harvest
evidence only): both `empty` and `linked` source variants, all six
column shapes, and `insert-rows`/`delete-rows` writeback. See that file
for the full reference.
