## Consulting the OpenAPI

The Sigma OpenAPI is the canonical schema for every request/response
shape. When this skill and the OpenAPI disagree, the OpenAPI wins. Fetch
once per session and inspect with `jq`:

```bash
curl -sf https://help.sigmacomputing.com/openapi/sigma-computing-public-rest-api.json > /tmp/sigma-api.json

# Workbook spec POST request body
jq '.paths."/v2/workbooks/spec".post.requestBody.content."application/json".schema' /tmp/sigma-api.json

# A specific element kind's full shape
jq '.components.schemas.BarChart' /tmp/sigma-api.json
jq '.components.schemas.KpiChart' /tmp/sigma-api.json

# List every schema name (when you don't know the right one)
jq -r '.components.schemas | keys[]' /tmp/sigma-api.json | grep -i <hint>
```

Every per-element file in this directory opens with the relevant `jq`
recipe. Use it whenever a field shape has changed or the skill's coverage
doesn't include a feature you need.

### OpenAPI reference — known-dead URL (2026-08-04)

**The URL above is confirmed dead** — `curl -I` returns a real `HTTP
404` (a proper Fern-docs 404 page, not a transient network error).
Sigma's docs site has restructured onto a Fern-hosted "Available APIs"
index at `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/openapi.json`, which
currently lists exactly two downloadable bundles:

- `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/openapi/sigma-rest-api.json` (181
  paths — workbook/folder/member/schedule management endpoints)
- `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/openapi/code-representation.json`
  (only 2 paths: `/v2/dataModels/{dataModelId}/spec` and
  `/v2/dataModels/spec` — data-model specs only)

**Neither current bundle contains the workbook-spec element-kind
schemas** (`BarChart`, `KpiChart`, `CommonElement`, `WorkbookSpec`,
etc.) that the `jq` recipes above and every per-element file in this
directory depend on — confirmed by grepping both fetched bundles for
`"bar-chart"` (zero matches in either) and for `Workbook`/`Element`
schema names (present, but none matching the workbook-spec element
shapes). The schema this skill has been using all along (11 top-level
schemas incl. `WorkbookSpec`, `CommonElement`, `BarChart`'s enum
definitions) came from the now-dead URL and isn't currently reachable
through Sigma's own docs-site navigation via any bundle this session
could locate. This is a Sigma docs-site gap, not a missing-URL puzzle
to solve — don't guess at replacement paths (e.g. a "content-hash"
path was floated in one session and could not be verified; treat that
as unconfirmed).

**Practical fallback:** if a session already has a `/tmp/sigma-api.json`
cached from before this broke, it remains valid and was used
successfully as late as 2026-08-04 (see `reference/history.md` →
"2026-08-04 — bar-chart orientation" for a live example: it correctly
identified `orientation`'s enum as `["horizontal"]`-only). A fresh
session with no cached copy has no known way to re-fetch that specific
schema — fall back to this skill's "Probe first, then document"
doctrine (live-POST bisection against the real API) as the primary
way to resolve field-shape questions for workbook-spec elements, not a
fallback of last resort. See `reference/capability-ledger.md` →
"retest protocol."

### Schema-drift signal

If a POST/PUT fails with `invalid argument`, `unknown field`,
`unexpected property`, `missing required field`, `unrecognized parameter`,
or a 400 about request *shape* rather than data — the API has evolved
since this skill was written. Fallback in `reference/workflows/crud.md` →
"Schema drift."

This file covers what the OpenAPI alone won't tell you: which fields are
response-only, the ID-preservation guarantee on CREATE, and a minimal
working example. For per-element shapes, see the per-element files in
this directory.

## Top-level object

```json
{
  "name": "My Workbook",
  "folderId": "<folder-uuid>",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "pages": [...],
  "elements": [...],
  "layout": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>...</Page>..."
}
```

**Required:** `name`, `folderId`, `schemaVersion`, `pages`, `elements`.
**Optional:** `description`, `layout`, `settings`, `overlays`.

**Breaking change, confirmed live 2026-08-10:** `elements` is now a
single flat top-level array — `document.pages[].elements` is rejected
outright (see "Wire format" below). Page objects carry only
`{id, name, pageWidth?, visibility?}`; page membership for an element
is determined entirely by which `<Page id="...">` block its `<Element
elementId="...">`/`<Container elementId="...">` tag sits under in the
layout XML — there is no `pageId` field on elements. `settings` (theme
overrides live at `settings.theme.overrides`) and `overlays` (modal
pages) are new top-level siblings — see "Theming" above and
`pages.md` → "Modal pages" respectively.

See `reference/workflows/crud.md` → "schemaVersion — don't hardcode"
for the rule on `schemaVersion`. Existing exemplars use `1`; future
versions will require reading from a reference GET.

## Wire format — the live API wraps the document under a `document` key

**This section is about transport, not authoring.** Every shape
described in this file and the rest of `reference/specification/` is
the **flat authoring shape** — `schemaVersion`/`pages`/`layout`/etc. as
top-level siblings of `name`/`folderId`. Keep authoring that shape.
This section explains what happens between writing that JSON and it
reaching the live API.

**Confirmed 2026-08-04 via direct live-POST/PUT/GET testing** (not
GET-spec-only — a bare flat-shape spec was actively POSTed and
rejected, confirming this isn't a passive artifact): the real Sigma
REST API nests `schemaVersion`, `kind`, `pages`, `elements`, `layout`,
`settings`, `overlays`, `folders`, and `agents` under a top-level
`document` key. Only `name`, `folderId`, and `description` remain true
top-level siblings on the request (plus response-only metadata — see
below — which also lives outside `document`). `document.kind` is
**required** and is always the literal string `"workbook"`.

**Correction (2026-08-10):** `themeOverrides` was previously listed
here as a `document`-nested key — it no longer exists at any top
level. Confirmed live: `document.themeOverrides` is rejected outright
(`{"message":"document.themeOverrides is no longer supported. Use
document.settings.theme.overrides instead."}`). Theme overrides now
live at `document.settings.theme.overrides`. See "Theming" below and
`reference/specification/theming.md`.

```json
{
  "name": "My Workbook",
  "folderId": "<folder-uuid>",
  "document": {
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "kind": "workbook",
    "pages": [...],
    "elements": [...],
    "layout": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" ...?>...</Page>...",
    "settings": { "theme": { "overrides": {...} } },
    "overlays": [...]
  }
}
```

POSTing the flat shape as-is against the live API is rejected with a
large union-type validation error naming paths like `0.document.0.0.0`
— easy to misread as unrelated schema drift rather than "wrap this in
a `document` key." A GET on an existing workbook's spec confirms the
same nesting comes back on read: `{"workbookId": ..., "document":
{"schemaVersion": 1, "kind": "workbook", "pages": [...], ...}}`.

**You do not need to hand-wrap this.** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh`
wraps flat → wire on `post`/`put` and unwraps wire → flat on
`get-spec`, transparently, so the flat shape stays the one authoring
convention across this skill's tooling, examples, and docs. This only
matters to you if you POST/PUT/GET directly via raw `curl` instead of
through that script (e.g. ad-hoc schema investigation) — in that case
wrap/unwrap by hand per the shape above.

A separate claim from the same investigation — that successful
POST/PUT responses come back as plain `key: value` text instead of
JSON — was checked and is **not real** for this skill's actual call
path: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/api/_env.sh`'s `sigma_curl` helper already sends
`Accept: application/json` (every script in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/api/` goes
through it), and the API honors that header on both GET and POST/PUT.
The plain-text response only appears when that header is omitted
(e.g. a raw `curl` call made outside `sigma_curl` during ad-hoc
bisection). No dual-format response parsing was added anywhere in this
skill's tooling — it wasn't needed.

See `reference/history.md` → "2026-08-04 — document wrapper" for the
full incident and verification trail, and
`reference/capability-ledger.md` for how this affects the dating of
earlier POST evidence in that ledger.

## Response-only fields

`GET /v2/workbooks/<id>/spec` also returns these. **Correction
(2026-08-03):** previously stated they "must be stripped... sending
unknown top-level fields is rejected" — the real upstream `sigma-workbooks`
skill states the opposite: these fields are **ignored on write**
(POST/PUT), so a GET response can be re-submitted without stripping them
first, though doing so is cleaner and is still the recommended practice
below:

- `workbookId`
- `url`
- `documentVersion`
- `latestDocumentVersion`
- `ownerId`
- `createdBy`
- `updatedBy`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/workbook-manifest.py` recognizes these and won't flag them
as unknown. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/validate-spec.py` warns when they're present on
a file being POSTed.

## Pages

`pages` and `elements` are both top-level siblings of `name`/`folderId`
(**breaking change, confirmed live 2026-08-10** — see "Wire format"
above). A page entry no longer carries its own `elements[]`; it's just:

```json
{
  "id": "page-overview",
  "name": "Overview"
}
```

Optional page-level keys:

- `visibility: "hidden"` — hides the page from the workbook's tab bar.
  See `reference/specification/text.md` and the iteration pattern in
  `reference/workflows/plan.md`.
- `description` — page-level description string.
- `pageWidth` — per-page width override.

All elements for every page live in the single top-level `elements[]`
array (tables, charts, KPIs, controls, containers, text, dividers, and
images — see the per-element reference files). An element's page
membership isn't a field on the element at all — it's determined by
the layout XML: whichever `<Page id="...">` block an element's
`<Element elementId="...">` (or `<Container elementId="...">`) tag is
nested under is the page it renders on. See
`reference/specification/layout.md`.

## ID rules

- Element IDs and column IDs must be **unique within their scope**
  (the same `id` on different pages is allowed; the same `id` twice
  in one page is not).
- Use descriptive kebab-case or short random-looking IDs — both are
  fine. IDs are internal identifiers, not displayed to users.
- **IDs are preserved verbatim on `POST`.** Pages, elements, and
  columns keep the `id` values you sent. Layout `elementId`
  references stay valid across POST/PUT round-trips. You can save a
  spec, edit it, and `PUT` it back directly using the same IDs.
- Layout `elementId` references must match an element `id` on that
  page exactly (case-sensitive).

Verified 2026-07-02 against harvested exemplars: skill-authored
workbooks (`plugs-geography-yoy`, `store-performance-pop`) retained
100% of their kebab-case IDs after POST/GET round-trip.

## Layout

`layout` is a top-level XML string carrying one `<Page>` element per
workbook page. Multi-page workbooks concatenate the per-page XML docs
(each with its own `<?xml ?>` declaration). See
`reference/specification/layout.md`.

## Top-level `folders` field

Optional. Carries column-folder groupings for the workbook. Most
workbooks omit it. When present, looks like:

```json
"folders": [
  { "id": "ejtrqOFhcK", "name": "Store Fields", "items": [...] }
]
```

The `items` are column IDs grouped under the folder name. UI-side
organization; doesn't affect render. Inspect via
`GET /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec`'s `folders` field (or
`mcp-describe.sh workbook <wb-id>` — see
`reference/workflows/discover.md` → "MCP status") if you need the
structure.

## Theming (`settings.theme.overrides` + theme color references)

Moved to its own chunk: **`reference/specification/theming.md`**
(2026-08-04, Wave 4 / C7; relocated again 2026-08-10 — see below).
Includes a correction: what earlier versions of this file called a
standalone `"kind": "theme"` **element** does not exist — live-POST
tested and rejected (`Invalid kind: "theme"`). The `{kind:"theme", ref}`
shape is real, but it's a **reusable color-value form** usable inside
`style.color`/`borderColor`/`backgroundColor` and similar fields across
many element kinds, not a page element in its own right. See that file
for the full, corrected reference.

**Breaking change, confirmed live 2026-08-10:** top-level
`document.themeOverrides` is now rejected outright:
`{"message":"document.themeOverrides is no longer supported. Use
document.settings.theme.overrides instead."}`. The new home is
`document.settings.theme.overrides` — same field names/values inside,
only the nesting changed. `themeName` moved the same way, to
`document.settings.theme.name` (a UUID string). See `theming.md` for
the full corrected reference.

## Minimal working example

The smallest spec that creates a workable workbook:

```json
{
  "name": "Sales Dashboard",
  "folderId": "<folder-uuid>",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "page-1",
      "name": "Overview"
    }
  ],
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "sales-table",
      "kind": "table",
      "name": "Sales Data",
      "source": {
        "kind": "warehouse-table",
        "connectionId": "<conn-uuid>",
        "path": ["SALES_DB", "PUBLIC", "ORDERS"]
      },
      "columns": [
        { "id": "col-order-id", "name": "Order ID", "formula": "[ORDERS/order_id]" },
        { "id": "col-amount",   "name": "Amount",   "formula": "[ORDERS/amount]" },
        { "id": "col-total",    "name": "Total",    "formula": "Sum([Amount])" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `[ORDERS/order_id]` references a warehouse column (table prefix required).
- `Sum([Amount])` references the "Amount" column defined in the same
  element (no prefix).
