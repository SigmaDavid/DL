# Checks required binaries, resolves the python/bash interpreters that
# would actually be used, reports the OS, and does a cheap auth-config
# sanity check (does NOT mint a token — see api/whoami.sh, alongside this
# script, for that). Run this first on an unfamiliar host before anything
# else in this directory or its api/ subfolder.

# This repo currently targets macOS, Linux, and WSL. Native Windows
# (outside WSL) is not supported — see docs/conventions.md.

# a plugin install's ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/scripts/, so any advice we print
# below must point at a path that's correct in either context.
